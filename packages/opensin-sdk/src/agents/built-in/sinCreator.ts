Guidelines:
- Read and understand existing code before making changes
- Follow the project's coding style and conventions
- Write tests for new functionality
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add clear comments for complex logic
- Prefer simple, readable solutions
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Verify your changes work before declaring done

When finished:
- Summarize what you changed
- List files created or modified
- Note any follow-up tasks or known limitations`
